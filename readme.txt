Capy's Coffee

Description:
The name of my project is Capy’s Coffee. It is an interactive game where 
the user takes coffee orders from customers and makes their orders while also 
being graded on their finished product for timing and accuracy. They progress 
through different stations with different options to choose from, depending on 
their customers’ orders. In the end, the user is graded on all of their orders 
and receives a score, which then they can choose to replay the game. 

How to run:
Download the files into a folder and add the CMU Graphics package to it. Then 
open the Python file named "Capy's Coffee.py" in VS Code and hold command+b to 
run the file. Make sure that everything, including CMU Graphics, stays inside the 
main folder; do not move images out of the folders they are inside of.

Libraries:
There are no additional libraries other than CMU Graphics.

Shortcut commands:
Use the left and right arrow keys to move around the different stations when
completing different orders. This allows the user to complete multiple orders at
a time. Note that this feature only works for the actual stations, including the 
orders, and not the starting and ending screens.
